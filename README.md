# Deployment Process

2.Build your Application Jar and copy the Jar from target folder to Application parent folder where app.yaml exists

3.In the Google Cloud SDK shell use the **gcloud init** command and select your application which you created earlier in gcp and select the region for app deployment

4.Now open the new command prompt and switch application directory and run the **gcloud app deploy** command

5.If there are any errors during the deployment ,it will show in the command prompt

6.For Cloud application build details you can check at https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds

7.For artifacts and docker images related you can check at https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts/docker

8.For the Application logs you can visit https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards

# Note:

1.Your application should run on port 8080 as GCP app engine checks readiness and liveness on 8080

2.Use Java17 and Spring boot 3.X.X for seamless deployments
